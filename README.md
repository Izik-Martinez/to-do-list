# to-do-list

I'll be coding a to-do list using what I've learned about loops.

     It was satisfying to create a small project with almost everything I've been learning about Javascript: variables, conditionals, arrays, loops, etc. This is a momumental project for me because 3 months ago I would've never guessed I'd write a program in JS on my own. I'm beginning to understand the thought-processes required to solve problems with a programming language. Although it's only a small to-do list "app", I'm pleased with my progress thus far. Only up from here!
